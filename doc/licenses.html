<b>IMPORTANT</b> 
<b>READ CAREFULLY: This ACME End-User License Agreement (&quot;EULA&quot;) is a legal 
agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and ACME Corporation for the 
ACME software product identified above, which includes computer software and may include 
associated media, printed materials, and &quot;online&quot; or electronic documentation 
(&quot;SOFTWARE PRODUCT&quot;). The SOFTWARE PRODUCT also includes any updates and 
supplements to the original SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to you by ACME. Any software provided 
along with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that is associated with a separate end-user license 
agreement is licensed to you under the terms of that license agreement. By installing, 
copying, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be 
bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not 
install or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; you may, however, return it to your place of purchase 
for a full refund.</b><br><br> 
<h2>SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE</h2>The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other 
intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.

<ul> 
<li><b>Applications Software.</b> You may install, use, access, display, run, or otherwise 
interact with (&quot;RUN&quot;) one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, or any prior version for 
the same operating system, on a single computer, workstation, terminal, handheld PC, pager, 
&quot;smart phone,&quot; or other digital electronic device (&quot;COMPUTER&quot;). The 
primary user of the COMPUTER on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is installed may make a second 
copy for his or her exclusive use on a portable computer. 
<li><b>Reservation of Rights.</b> All rights not expressly granted are reserved by ACME. 
</ul><p>
<li><b>DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.</b> 
<ul>

SOFTWARE PRODUCT (&quot;Support Services&quot;). Use of Support Services is governed by the 
ACME policies and programs described in the user manual, in &quot;online&quot;

provided to you as part of the Support Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT and subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA.

one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT only directly to an end user. 
This transfer must include all of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including all component parts, the 
media and printed materials, any upgrades, this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of 
Authenticity). Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any other indirect 
transfer. The transferee of such one-time transfer must agree to comply with the terms of 
this EULA, including the obligation not to further transfer this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT. 
<li><b>Termination.</b> Without prejudice to any other rights, ACME may terminate this EULA 
if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA. In such event, you must 
destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and all of its component parts. 
</ul><p>
<li><b>COPYRIGHT.</b> All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including but 
not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and 
&quot;applets&quot; incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT), the accompanying printed 
materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are owned by ACME or its suppliers. All 
title and intellectual property rights in and to the content that may be accessed through 
use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is the property of the respective content owner and may be 
protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties. This 
EULA grants you no rights to use such content. If this SOFTWARE PRODUCT contains 
documentation that is provided only in electronic form, you may print one copy of such 
electronic documentation. You may not copy the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT.<p>
<li><b>BACKUP COPY.</b> After installation of one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pursuant to 
this EULA, you may keep the original media on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT was provided by 
ACME solely for backup or archival purposes. If the original media is required to use the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT on the COMPUTER, you may make one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT solely for 
backup or archival purposes. Except as expressly provided in this EULA, you may not 
otherwise make copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the printed materials accompanying the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT.<p>
<li><b>U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.</b> All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S. 
Government pursuant to solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995 is provided with 
the commercial rights and restrictions described elsewhere herein. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT 
provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to solicitations issued prior to December 1, 1995 
is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS as provided for in FAR, 48 CFR 52.227-14 (JUNE 1987) or 
FAR, 48 CFR 252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), as applicable.<p>
<li><b>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. </b>This SOFTWARE PRODUCT has been classified by the US 
Government as exportable under License Exception TSU. Therefore the following terms apply: 
You agree that you will not export or re-export the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, any part thereof, or 
any process or service that is the direct product of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (the foregoing 
collectively referred to as the Restricted Components), to any country, person or entity 
subject to U.S. export restrictions. You specifically agree not to export or re-export any 
of the Restricted Components (i) to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed or 
restricted the export of goods or services, which currently include, but are not necessarily 
limited to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, or to any national of any 
such country, wherever located, who intends to transmit or transport the Restricted 
Components back to such country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or have reason to 
know will utilize the Restricted Components in the design, development or production of 
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any person or entity who has been 
prohibited from participating in U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. 
government. You warrant and represent that neither the Bureau of Export Administration nor 
any other U.S. federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges. 
</ol><p>
<h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>This EULA is governed by the laws of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States of America.<br><br> 
<h2>LIMITED WARRANTY</h2>ACME warrants that (a) the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for 
a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt, and (b) any Support Services provided 
by ACME shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to you 
by ACME, and ACME support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts to solve any 
problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an 
implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you. <br><br> 
<br> 
<b>CUSTOMER REMEDIES.</b> ACMEs and its suppliersentire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at ACMEs option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or (b) repair or 
replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet ACMEs Limited Warranty and which is 
returned to ACME with a copy of your receipt. This Limited Warranty is void if failure of 
the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or 
thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. <br><br> 
<b><u>NO OTHER WARRANTIES</u>. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACME AND 
ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND 
THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES.<i> </i>THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES 
YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO 
STATE/JURISDICTION.<br> 
</b>&nbsp;<br> 
<b><u>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</u>. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no 
event shall ACME or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or 
consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of 
business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other 
pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the 
provision of or failure to provide Support Services, even if ACME has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages. In any case, ACMEs entire liability under any provision of this 
EULA shall be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT or U.S. $5.00; provided, however, if you have entered into a ACME Support Services 
Agreement, ACMEs entire liability regarding Support Services shall be governed by the terms 
of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or 
limitation of liability, the above limitation may not apply to you.</td></tr><tr id="altCol"><td>Apache License 2.0</td><td>elasticsearch, fluent-plugin-kibana-server, Apache License 2.0, kibana, logstash, Bootstrap, Apache License 2.0</td><td><H1><center>Apache License<br />
